# IOhub

Immuno-Oncology hub (IOhub) is an interactive data repository based on R Shiny for researchers to investigate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treated tumor samples in bulk-RNAseq and single cell RNAseq data. In IOhub, we have collected 1,409 ICB-treated tumor samples from 21 bulk-RNAseq datasets and 243 samples from 8 scRNAseq datasets, covering 12 cancer types.
